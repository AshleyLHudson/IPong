# IPong
This has been my summer project (2019) and main goal to get compleate! It was made with sprite kit, Swift and designed to be as simple as possible! 
# Difficulties 
The game includes various difficulties, easy, medium and hard and each difficulties is reflected on how the bot can react to the ball. This is done by a delay effect which means that its more easier to score if the bot is slower (easy) and as you change the level, the delay effect gets reduced further.
# Outcome
